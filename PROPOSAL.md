# Project Proposal: Predicting FC Barcelona Match Outcomes Using Machine Learning

## a. Who: Proposed Client
The proposed client for this project is the Bar√ßa Innovation Hub, FC Barcelona's dedicated platform for sports research and innovation.

## b. Why: Question/Topic Being Investigated
The primary objective is to predict the outcomes of FC Barcelona's matches (win, draw, loss). (add more details)

## c. How: Plan of Attack
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical match data for FC Barcelona, focusing on various performance metrics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and construct relevant features that may impact match outcomes, such as possession percentage, shots on goal, pass accuracy, etc.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose at least three machine learning models, including linear and non-linear classifiers, to predict match outcomes.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the selected models on the historical data and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Comparison**: Compare the models based on their performance metrics to determine the most effective one for this classification task.

## d. What: Dataset, Models, Framework, Components
- **Dataset**: (to be completed) 

- **Models**:
  1. **Logistic Regression**: A linear model serving as a baseline for classification.
  2. **Random Forest Classifier**: A non-linear ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
  3. **XGBoost Classifier**: An advanced gradient boosting model known for its efficiency and performance in classification tasks.

- **Framework and Components**:
  - **Programming Language**: Python
  - **Libraries**: pandas (data manipulation), scikit-learn (machine learning), XGBoost (gradient boosting), matplotlib/seaborn (data visualization)
  - **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

- **Link to dataset**: (to be completed)
