# **Proposal: Predicting FC Barcelona Match Outcomes using Machine Learning**

## **a. Who: Proposed Client**  
The proposed client for this project is **FC Barcelona’s Data Analytics Department** within the **Barça Innovation Hub**. This department is responsible for leveraging **data-driven insights** to improve the club’s performance through predictive analytics.

---

## **b. Why: Question/Topic Being Investigated**  
The objective of this project is to develop a **machine learning model** that can predict **FC Barcelona’s match outcomes (win, draw, loss)** based on key performance indicators (**KPIs**) from historical matches. Understanding the **factors that influence match results** will help the club optimize its strategies and improve **on-field decision-making**.

---

## **c. How: Plan of Attack**  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Use a **historical match performance dataset** containing relevant KPIs (e.g., possession, shots on goal, pass accuracy).  
   - The dataset will be sourced from **Kaggle**.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Clean and normalize the dataset.  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Train and compare **three different machine learning models**:  
     - **Logistic Regression** (baseline, linear model).  
     - **Random Forest Classifier** (ensemble, non-linear).  
     - **Gradient Boosting Classifier** (non-linear, iterative learning).  

4. **Evaluation & Validation**  
   - Compare models based on **accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix**.  
   - Perform **cross-validation** to ensure robustness.  

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Identify the most influential features affecting match outcomes.  
   - Provide tactical recommendations for **game strategies** based on model findings.

## **d. What: Dataset, Models, Framework, Components**  

### **Dataset**  
- **FC Barcelona Match Performance Dataset** (from Kaggle).  
- Includes **200 match observations** with detailed **KPIs** and corresponding match results.  
- **Dataset link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics)  

### **Machine Learning Models**  
- **Logistic Regression** – A simple, interpretable model for baseline predictions.  
- **Random Forest Classifier** – Captures complex feature interactions using an ensemble of decision trees.  
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier** – Enhances model accuracy by iteratively improving weak classifiers.  

### **Frameworks & Tools**  
- **Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).**  
- **Jupyter Notebook/PyCharm** for implementation.  
- **Model evaluation techniques:** Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, cross-validation.
