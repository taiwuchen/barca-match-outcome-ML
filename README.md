# FC Barcelona Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements machine learning models to predict FC Barcelona match outcomes. The models compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict whether Barcelona will win, draw, or lose based on performance metrics.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**  
   Download the FC Barcelona Match Performance Dataset from Kaggle:  
   [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics)

2. **Save the Dataset**  
   Save the downloaded CSV file in the same directory as this project.

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the `main.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.


## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
