# FC Barcelona Match Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning

This project implements machine learning models to predict FC Barcelona match outcomes. The models compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to predict whether Barcelona will win, draw, or lose based on performance metrics.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Dataset**  
   Download the FC Barcelona Match Performance Dataset from Kaggle:  
   [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adnanshaikh10/fc-barcelona-statistics)

2. **Save the Dataset**  
   Save the downloaded CSV file in the same directory as this project.

3. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the Python script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and explore its structure and contents.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand patterns and distributions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Model Comparison**: Compare the performance of the models and identify the best-performing one.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Analyze the importance of features for the best-performing model.
